TL;DR | A quick layout generator for Bootstrap 3.Visit the link above

Bootstrap 3 has a new super-powerful [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) with four tiers of grid classes—phones, tablets, desktops, and large desktops—you can do some super crazy awesome layouts.But it quickly gets complicated as you try to wrap your head around it.Bootstrap 3 is more flexible in terms of what it can do but keeping 3 different layouts in your head simultaneously is very complex.

The Bootstrap 3 Grid Builder enables to quickly create responsive layouts using just drag and drop.
It allows you to quickly test layouts on all types of devices fast & prototype and iterate faster.
You can increase widths and offsets and , add different spans of columns while the Builder takes care of the optimization of html code generated.
